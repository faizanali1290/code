// !what is io
// IO stands for Input/Output. It refers to the communication between a computer or device and its external environment, such as reading from or writing to files, networks, or devices.

// Emit events: To send data from the client to the server, you can use the socket.emit() method. For example, if you want to send a "chat message" event with a message payload, you can use the following code
//?socket.emit('chat message', 'Hello, server!');

// Receive events: To listen for events from the server, you can use the socket.on() method. For example, to listen for "chat message" events, you can use the following code

// ?  socket.on('chat message', (message) => {
//?console.log('Received message:', message);
//?});
